						<h3> EDWARD BROWN | LEAD SOFTWARE DEVELOPER </h3>
						<p> Hi there! When Emilia approached me about creating a technology that enables easier medical communication back in 2018, I was immediately interested. It's important to me that healthcare is accessible to everyone! I hope to use my past experiences at Google and Amazon to develop DependaDoc. </p>

						<h3> DR EMILIA RAMOS | FOUNDER & CHIEF HEALTH CONSULTANT </h3>
						<p> I noticed that a lot of elderly were letting their health suffer because they were baffled by technology.  When I asked them why they didn't just visit a virtual doctor, they all responded, "It's just too complicated!" I'll hope you join me on this journey of eliminating boundaries and making it easy for everyone to get the help they need!</p>

						<h3> JAMES ROBERT | CHIEF MARKET ANALYST </h3>
						<p> My colleagues struggled to find a technology that sufficiently covered all the bases that they needed in their appointments while also functioning as an easily learned software for some of their older patients. The DependaDoc team worked with me to create a brilliant technology that solves all these problems. Join us in providing quality healthcare to everyone, all around the globe! </p>

				<h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
				<hr class = "blueHr">
				<br>

				<h2> 2018 </h2>
				<p> After Dr.Ramos became increasingly aware of the issues surrounding medical telecommunications and the struggle of finding a dependable service, she decided to make a change through creating her own company. This is how DependaDoc was born! To make this a reality, in spring of 2018, she reached out to two of her acquaintances, Edward Brown and James Robert, and the team began the planning process.
 </p>
				<br>

				<h2> 2019 </h2>
				<p>  Upon finalizing the various stages of work needed to plan and create the best possible version of DependaDoc, the team launched our service!  We had an amazing launch, and in just the first year of providing quality medical telecommunications, DependaDoc became a popular name with over 5,000 clients across America and 10,000 worldwide! </p>
				<br>

				<h2> 2020 - Now </h2>
				<p> The DependaDoc team has grown as our services became more and more widespread, but at heart we still uphold the values of Dr.Ramos. Ever since our founding, we constantly strive to improve DependaDoc and maintain the highest standard quality for our clients. DependaDoc is here for you, and we will always ensure that you receive the quality telemedicine you deserve!  </p>
