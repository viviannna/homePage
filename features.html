            <div class="bigComment">When I first heard of it, I admit I was pretty hesitant to use DependaDoc because of the many other options on the market. However, I am so glad I took the chance because DependaDoc is WAY better than all the other services I've tried! The notetaking feature is so convenient for me, and I love having all my data in the same place! Well worth it! It has completely changed the way my online doctoring practice runs. </div>

            <div class="bigLabel">Only Thing That Worked for My Parents</div>
            <div class="bigComment"> During this pandemic, my elderly parents have been forced to shift completely to online healthcare. We’ve tried so many confusing services and this transition was really difficult for them: until we tried out DependaDoc! The platform is so simple to use, the video quality is great, and it's such a convenient way to contact your doctor! 10/10 would recommend - our whole family loves it! </div>

            <div class="bigComment">This is by far the BEST medical telecommunications service my hospital has ever tried! I'm a hospital administrator, and when we first made the shift to virtual services, it was so hard to keep track of all of the doctors and consultations. DependaDoc has been a lifesaver! It optimizes time for the doctors and keeps records of everything for us! I never have to wonder about missing anything anymore, because I know DependaDoc has my back. You NEED to try this service; I guarantee you'll never look back!</div>

            <div class="bigLabel">More convenient and streamlined than an actual doctor’s office!</div>
            <div class="bigComment">When I had to switch to online doctors visits because of this pandemic, I was really worried about how it would affect my quality of healthcare. Leaving behind in-person doctor visits seemed concerning, but DependaDoc has been amazing! I love the ease of joining my appointments right when I need to without wasting hours in waiting rooms and filling out forms. The doctors are always prepared with my information, the video quality is great, and my healthcare has been so much more efficient! My experience with DependaDoc has been excellent, and I will be a lifelong client.</div>
