				<h2>Context</h2>
				<p>Due to recent global events, consumers and the healthcare industry were forced to change their medical screening practices. Virtual appointments via mobile interfacing and webcam communications have been used for patients that were unable to or restricted from physically seeing a doctor.</p>
				<br>
				<hr class = "blueHr">
				<br>
				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>Create a fictional medical telecommunications company and design a website. The website should serve as a guide for information about the company and their communication services provided. Present an overview of services as if you were a consumer. Provide the type of solutions your company creates, sells, and/or serves. Sections of the site may include photos, product descriptions, renderings, company history, contact, and news updates.</p>
